How to play
West Bank has 12 doors with one cashier each. Only 3 doors are visible at a time. Your job as a banker is to accept at least one deposit from each of the 12 cashiers by the bank's clients. But be careful! Various robbers want to rob your bank. You must shoot any robber who has drawn a gun but not before he draws. There is also a kid wearing 7 hats which you can shoot to reveal a money bag or a bomb hidden underneath them.
If the bank closes before you accept one deposit from each door you will lose a life.
